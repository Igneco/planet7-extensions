Currently just a place for me to play with Shapeless to see if it can solve some problems in the world of CSV mungeing

FYI, Shapeless rocks. I don't understand how it works. I don't understand the types of problems that it solves, except that it solves one problem that is dear to my heart: shipping data between CSVs and case classes
